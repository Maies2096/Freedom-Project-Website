# SEP10 Freedom Project
by Maie Sayed

## Context
<p> The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about "applying the content you are learning in daily lessons to your own creation". You have to chose a programming language of your own linking, and learn the content that goes into the language. Throughout the process, you are supposed to "reflect upon your learning in a blog". Once times runs out, you are supposed to "present your product and processes" in the form of a website and a presentation.</p>

<p>The purpose of this project is use skills ranging from problem-decomposition and time-managment to how-to-read and how-to-learn in order to compile a website of a topic that we fancy using a language that we chose to learn, and the information that we progressively learned throughout the year.</p>


## Content
<p>For my project, I am making a website about Experimental Science using Jekyll, Github, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. This project includes a website, a blog, and a presentation. In the blog, I walk through my process of independently studying All-Things-Science, and making the website. The website is the result of my yearlong study, and the presentation is a quick debrief of both the website, and the blog.</p>
